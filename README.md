## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
Today's students face challenges in maintaining focus, managing tasks, and staying motivated in their studies. To tackle these issues, we propose developing a gamified productivity app.

### Purpose and Goals
The app aims to address common struggles among students, including:
- **Task Management**: Providing a visually appealing platform for organizing assignments, homework, and deadlines.
- **Focus and Concentration**: By incorporating gamification elements, the app will incentivize users to stay focused and improve concentration.
- **Motivation and Engagement**: Through goal-setting, progress tracking, and rewards systems, the app will keep students motivated and engaged in their academic pursuits.

### Scope
- Development of the gamified productivity app.
- Integration of task management features.
- Integration with Google Calendar.
- Development of a leaderboard feature for friendly competition.
- Interval notifications to keep users on track.

#### Limitations or Exclusions
- The app will not cover AI functionalities like task scheduling and recommendations.
- Limited to students and educational contexts.
